    <span class="ti ti-apps"></span>&nbsp;
    <span>Why this app?</span>
  </h2>
  <p>In some countries, the official application to use for storing the certificate is
     bloated with other features, and sometimes even incompatible with some phones.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, spikes in COVID-19 new cases enforces governments to rely more and more
    on these certificates to allow people to still live a regular life (well, kinda).

    <span class="ti ti-help"></span>&nbsp;
    <span>Can I help?</span>
  </h2>
  <p>Sure! This application is <strong>Open Source</strong> and MIT-licensed. </p>
  <p>You can download the source code, and contribute to it. The source code is accessible
    on this <a href="https://github.com/bchanudet/covid-certificate-pwa">Github repository</a>.
    Even if you don't know how to code any contribution will be helpful. I will especially
    appreciate translations of the application to other languages.</p>

  <p>There is only me for now, <a href="https://benjaminchanudet.com">Benjamin Chanudet</a>.
    I'm a French developer based in Lyon and not totally psyched about using TousAntiCovid,
    the recommended application that needs Geolocation & Bluetooth permissions, and an exclusion
    to the phone's battery management system only to store a QR Code.</p>
  <p>More importantly, this application is not endorsed at all by any government or official service.</p>
